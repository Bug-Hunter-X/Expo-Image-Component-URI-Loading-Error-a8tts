This error typically occurs when using Expo's `Image` component with a URI that's not properly formatted or accessible.  It might stem from issues with your image source, network connectivity, or incorrect usage of the `Image` component itself.

**Example of problematic code:**
```javascript
<Image source={{ uri: 'http://example.com/image.jpg' }} style={{ width: 200, height: 200 }} />
```

If `http://example.com/image.jpg` is inaccessible, incorrectly formatted, or the server is down, this will lead to the error.
